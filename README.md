# Oris Emil Feliz Sala

  Hello, my name is Oris Feliz. I am a Game Developer currently seeking new ways to improve myself and become a better developer.
My goal is to one day lead a team of developers on a game that people will love and talk about for years to come.
I want to be a part of a game that people will look fondly over, or that people will say "hey I grew up with this",
or that "this made my childhood". Being a part of what makes people want to take up games and game development, 
like me and the games I grew up with, is my dream.

[Escape From The Orphanage](https://felizoris.itch.io/escape-the-orphanage)

Made in 72 hours, browser-based. You play as an orphan trying trying to escape a life of abuse from a dungeon-like foster home in one short level.

[Space Shooty](https://felizoris.itch.io/space-shooty)

Made in one month, Android only. You control a ship and survive as long as you can against a wave of ships. Game is made almost entirely by me, 
with the exception of music and sound effects.
